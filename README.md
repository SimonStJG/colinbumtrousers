Colin B. Trousers
=================

Issues:
 - Doesn't handle non-ascii very well.
 - Would be nicer to send the image as part of the email.
 - Need to rename all the auth stuff so it doesn't say "quickstart"
 - Haven't checked any of the requirements yet.

When it fails, need to run './colin.py reauth' this will regenerate
the client\_secret.json

password is recoverable from backup account


Need to update the credentials store so I can put it in the docker image
